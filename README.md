### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm ClÃ©ment

I'm a software developper from Lyon, France. Not much of what I have
done can be found online. I mainly use github for my configuration
files and the (far too) occasional open source contribution.

Currently, I work at NetApp. previusly I worked at [Cosmo Tech](https://www.cosmotech.com),
and wrote the first version of [MareyMap ðŸ“ˆ](https://github.com/aursiber/MareyMap). I also completed a
PhD in computer Science titled [Large Scale Parallel Inference of
Protein and Protein Domain
families ðŸ§¬](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00682495/document). For
more details about me please refer to [my cv](https://github.com/crezvoy/crezvoy/raw/master/cv-en.pdf).
